## Introduction

This repo is a collection of notes documenting the things I had to look up most when working between different languages. The correct way to use these cheat sheets is to `Ctrl + F` / `âŒ˜ + F` what you are looking for and find the syntax. While not a comprehensive guide to working in language, library, or framework, one is able to theoretically get started in that language quickly just by reading the cheat sheet.

If you discover typos, errors, or missed references, please don't hesitate to email me! I hope this will be useful.
